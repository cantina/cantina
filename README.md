Credits
-------
Cantina is the net result of our experiments with a number of different framesworks
and plugin systems. These include express, flatiron, broadway, and architect.
Architect, in particular was a tremendous source of influence (and code).
Gratitude goes out to the authors and contributors of those projects for helping
us learn more about node.js, what we need, and how to structure complex
applications.

Of course, none of this would be possible without our awesome employer,
Terra Eclipse.
